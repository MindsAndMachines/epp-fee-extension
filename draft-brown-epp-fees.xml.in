    <abstract><t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP) extension mapping for registry fees.</t></abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Historically, domain name registries have applied a simple fee
      structure for billable transactions, namely a basic unit price applied to
      domain &lt;create&gt;, &lt;renew&gt;, &lt;transfer&gt; and RGP restore
      commands. Given the relatively small number of EPP servers that EPP
      clients have been required to connect to, it has generally been the case
      that client operators have been able to obtain details of these fees
      out-of-band by contacting the server operators.</t>

      <t>Given the imminent expansion of the DNS namespace, and the
      proliferation of novel business models, it is now desirable to provide a
      method for EPP clients to query EPP servers for the fees associated with
      certain commands and specific objects.</t>

      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the 
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>. This
      EPP mapping provides a mechanism by which EPP clients may query the fees
      associated with various billable transactions.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"fee" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:fee-0.3". The XML namespace prefix "fee" is
        used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a
        proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output
        the XML documents.</t>

        <t>The XML namespace prefix above contains a version number,
        specifically "0.3". This version number will increment with successive
        versions of this document, and will reach 1.0 if and when this document
        is published as an RFC. This permits clients to distinguish which
        version of the extension a server has implemented.</t>

    <section title="EPP Command Mapping">

      <t>A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found in
      <xref target="RFC5730" />.</t>

      <section title="EPP Query Commands">
        <t>This extension does not add any elements to the EPP &lt;info&gt; or
        &lt;poll&gt; commands or responses.</t>

        <section title="EPP &lt;check&gt; Command">
          <t>This extension defines additional elements for the EPP
          &lt;check&gt; command.</t>

          <t>The command frame MAY contain an &lt;extension&gt; element which
          MAY contain one or more child &lt;fee:check&gt; elements with the
          following child elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A &lt;domain:name&gt; element that contains the domain name.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:currency&gt; element that contains the currency the fee
            is charged in. This must be a three-character currency code from
            <xref target="ISO4217"/> (Note: ISO 4217 provides the special "XXX"
            code which may be used if the server uses a non-currency based
            system for assessing fees, such as a system of credits).</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:action&gt; element identifying the command. The element
            values supported by the server is a matter of repository policy, but
            MUST include as a minimum the following values:
              <list>
                <t>"create" indicating a &lt;domain:create&gt; command;</t>
                <t>"renew" indicating a &lt;domain:renew&gt; command;</t>
                <t>"transfer" indicating a &lt;domain:transfer&gt; command;</t>
              </list>
            If the server supports the <xref target="RFC3915">Registry Grace
            Period Mapping</xref>, then the server MUST also support the
            "restore" value. The &lt;fee:action&gt; element MAY have an OPTIONAL
            "phase" attribute specifying a launch phase as described in
            <xref target="draft-tan-epp-launchphase" />. It may also contain an
            OPTIONAL "subphase" attribute identifying the custom or sub-phase
            as described in <xref target="draft-tan-epp-launchphase" />.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:period&gt; element that contains the number of units to
            be added to the registration period of the domain object.</t> 
          </list></t>

          <t>Example &lt;check&gt; command:</t>

   href="examples/check-command.txt" /></artwork></figure>

          <t>When the server receives a &lt;check&gt; command that includes the
          extension elements described above, its response MUST contain an
          &lt;extension&gt; element, which MUST contain a child
          &lt;fee:chkData&gt; element for each &lt;fee:check&gt; element
          contained in the command. The &lt;fee:chkData&gt; MUST contain the
          following child elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A &lt;domain:name&gt; element that contains a domain name which
            matches the name in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:currency&gt; element that contains same currency code
            that appeared in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:action&gt; element that contains same action
            that appeared in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element. This
            element MAY have the OPTIONAL "phase" and "subphase" elements, 
            which MUST match the same attributes in the corresponding
            &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:period&gt; element that contains same unit
            that appeared in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:fee&gt; element that contains the fee associated with
            the specified transaction.</t>
