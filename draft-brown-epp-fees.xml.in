    <abstract><t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP) extension mapping for registry fees.</t></abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Historically, domain name registries have applied a simple fee
      structure for billable transactions, namely a basic unit price applied to
      domain &lt;create&gt;, &lt;renew&gt;, &lt;transfer&gt; and <xref
      target="RFC3915">RGP</xref> restore commands. Given the relatively small
      number of EPP servers to which EPP clients have been required to connect,
      it has generally been the case that client operators have been able to
      obtain details of these fees out-of-band by contacting the server
      operators.</t>

      <t>Given the present expansion of the DNS namespace, and the proliferation
      of novel business models, it is now desirable to provide a method for EPP
      clients to query EPP servers for the fees and credits associated with
      certain commands and specific objects.</t>

      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the 
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>. This
      EPP mapping provides a mechanism by which EPP clients may query the fees
      and credits associated with various billable transactions, and also
      obtain their current account balance.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"fee" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:fee-&VERSION;". The XML namespace prefix "fee"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a
        proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output
        the XML documents.</t>

        <t>The XML namespace prefix above contains a version number,
        specifically "&VERSION;". This version number will increment with
        successive versions of this document, and will reach 1.0 if and when
        this document is published as an RFC. This permits clients to
        distinguish which version of the extension a server has implemented.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Extension Elements">

   <section title="Client Commands">
      <t>The &lt;fee:command&gt; element is used in EPP query commands to
      determine the command to which a fee is applicable.</t>

      <t>The element values permitted by the server is a matter of repository
      policy, but MUST include as a minimum the following values:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>"create" indicating a &lt;domain:create&gt; command;</t>
          <t>"renew" indicating a &lt;domain:renew&gt; command;</t>
          <t>"transfer" indicating a &lt;domain:transfer&gt; command;</t>
        </list>

      If the server supports the <xref target="RFC3915">Registry Grace Period
      Mapping</xref>, then the server MUST also support the "restore" value.</t>

      <t>The &lt;fee:command&gt; element MAY have an OPTIONAL "phase" attribute
      specifying a launch phase as described in
      <xref target="draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase" />. It may also contain an
      OPTIONAL "subphase" attribute identifying the custom or sub-phase as
      described in <xref target="draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase" />.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Currency Codes">
      <t>The &lt;fee:currency&gt; element is used to indicate which currency
      fees are charged in. This value of this element MUST be a three-character
      currency code from <xref target="ISO4217"/>.</t>

      <t>Note that ISO 4217 provides the special "XXX" code, which MAY be used
      if the server uses a non-currency based system for assessing fees, such as
      a system of credits.</t>
    </section>

	<section title="Fees and Credits">
	  <t>Servers which implement this extension will include elements in
	  response frames which provide information about the fees and/or credits
	  associated with a given billable transaction.</t>

	  <t>The &lt;fee:fee&gt; and &lt;fee:credit&gt; elements are used to provide
	  this information. The presence of a &lt;fee:fee&gt; element in a response
	  indicates a debit against the client's account balance; a
	  &lt;fee:credit&gt; element indicates a credit. A &lt;fee:fee&gt; element
	  MUST have a non-negative value. A &lt;fee:credit&gt; element MUST have a
	  negative value.</t>

	  <t>&lt;fee:fee&gt; and &lt;fee:credit&gt; elements MAY have an OPTIONAL
	  "description" attribute which provides a human-readable description of the
	  fee.</t>

	  <t>A server MAY respond with multiple &lt;fee:fee&gt; and
	  &lt;fee:credit&gt; elements in the same response. In such cases, the net
	  fee or credit applicable to the transaction is the arithmetic sum of the
	  values of each of the &lt;fee:fee&gt; or &lt;fee:credit&gt; elements.</t>
	</section>

    <section title="Account Balance">
      <t>The &lt;fee:balance&gt; element is an OPTIONAL element which MAY
      be included in server responses to transform commands. If present,
      it can be used by the client to determine the remaining credit at
      the server.</t>

      <t>Whether or not the &lt;fee:balance&gt; is included in response
      frames is a matter of server policy. However, if a server chooses
      to offer support for this element, it MUST be included responses
      to all transform commands (ie create, renew, update, delete,
      transfer request).</t>

      <t>The value of the &lt;fee:balance&gt; MAY be negative.</t>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section title="EPP Command Mapping">

      <t>A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found in
      <xref target="RFC5730" />.</t>

      <section title="EPP Query Commands">
        <t>This extension does not add any elements to the EPP &lt;poll&gt;
        command or response.</t>

        <section title="EPP &lt;check&gt; Command">
          <t>This extension defines additional elements for the EPP
          &lt;check&gt; command.</t>

          <t>The command frame MAY contain an &lt;extension&gt; element which
          MAY contain one or more child &lt;fee:check&gt; elements with the
          following child elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A &lt;domain:name&gt; element that contains a domain name.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:currency&gt; element that contains the currency the fee
            is charged in.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:command&gt; element identifying the command.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:period&gt; element that contains the number of units to
            be added to the registration period of the domain object.</t>

          <t>When the server receives a &lt;check&gt; command that includes the
          extension elements described above, its response MUST contain an
          &lt;extension&gt; element, which MUST contain a child
          &lt;fee:chkData&gt; element for each &lt;fee:check&gt; element
          contained in the command. The &lt;fee:chkData&gt; MUST contain the
          following child elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A &lt;domain:name&gt; element that contains a domain name which
            matches the name in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:currency&gt; element that contains same currency code
            that appeared in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:command&gt; element that contains same action
            that appeared in the corresponding &lt;fee:check&gt; element. This
            element MAY have the OPTIONAL "phase" and "subphase" elements, 
            which MUST match the same attributes in the corresponding
            &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:period&gt; element that contains same unit

        <section title="EPP &lt;info&gt; Command">
          <t>This extension defines additional elements for the EPP
          &lt;info&gt; command.</t>

          <t>The command frame MAY contain an &lt;extension&gt; element which

          elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>When the server receives an &lt;info&gt; command that includes the
          extension element described above, its response MUST (subject to the
          exceptions described below) contain an &lt;extension&gt; element,
          which MUST contain a child &lt;fee:infData&gt; element. The
          &lt;fee:infData&gt; MUST contain the following child elements:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A &lt;fee:currency&gt; element that contains same currency code

            have the OPTIONAL "phase" and "subphase" elements, which MUST match
            the same attributes in the original &lt;fee:check&gt; element.</t>

            <t>A &lt;fee:period&gt; element that contains same unit that
